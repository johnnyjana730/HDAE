B00A7D2L84-0017-0005	1 0 5	0	when I release it .
B00A7D2L84-0017-0006	1 0 6	-	Also , sometimes the kitty litter catches below the canister
B00A7D2L84-0017-0007	1 0 7	0	and falls out
B00A7D2L84-0017-0008	1 0 8	0	when I go to empty it .
B00A7D2L84-0017-0009	1 0 9	0	Neither is a deal breaker for me .

B00008V40C-0040-0001	1 1 1	0	The problem is
B00008V40C-0040-0002	1 1 2	-	that the opening on the bottom of the unit is too small .
B00008V40C-0040-0003	1 1 3	0	Forget about corners ,
B00008V40C-0040-0004	1 1 4	0	unless you are positioned right over

B000BXKIE4-0041-0004	1 2 4	-	The only problem
B000BXKIE4-0041-0005	1 2 5	0	I found so far
B000BXKIE4-0041-0006	1 2 6	0	-LRB- using for 2 months -RRB-
B000BXKIE4-0041-0007	1 2 7	0	is
B000BXKIE4-0041-0008	1 2 8	-	that it does n't turn very well .
B000BXKIE4-0041-0009	1 2 9	0	You have to do quite a bit of lifting and repositioning the vaccum
B000BXKIE4-0041-0010	1 2 10	0	to turn the unit .
B000BXKIE4-0018-0000	1 3 0	+	While the suction is very good ,
B000BXKIE4-0018-0001	1 3 1	-	the `` power nozzle '' is a piece of junk .
B000BXKIE4-0018-0002	1 3 2	0	We 've had two now
B000BXKIE4-0018-0003	1 3 3	-	and they quit working

B000BXKIE4-0018-0006	1 3 6	-	A call to Eletrolux customer service will convince you they have no customer service .
B000BXKIE4-0018-0007	1 3 7	-	E-mails get you nowhere .
B000BXKIE4-0018-0008	1 3 8	-	We will never buy another eletrolux product .
B000BXKIE4-0018-0009	1 3 9	-	Made in China says

B0009RF824-0007-0002	1 4 2	-	Does a poor job on my wood floors , my old fashioned broom does a better job .
B0009RF824-0007-0003	1 4 3	-	As for carpeting , does n't pick up anything .
B0009RF824-0007-0004	1 4 4	0	And pet hair ?

B00A7D2L84-0014-0003	2 0 3	0	Still cleaning , but have to always pay attention not to definitely break it .
B00A7D2L84-0014-0004	2 0 4	0	2 .
B00A7D2L84-0014-0005	2 0 5	-	The most annoying : very noisy after 6 months of use .
B00A7D2L84-0014-0006	2 0 6	0	My kids leave the room
B00A7D2L84-0014-0007	2 0 7	+	when I 'm getting close ...
B00A7D2L84-0014-0008	2 0 8	0	That was n't an issue at the beginning ,
B00A7D2L84-0014-0009	2 0 9	-	actually it was quiet but now it 's very annoying .
B00A7D2L84-0014-0010	2 0 10	-	Samsung is working on it right now , no vaccum cleaner for 2 weeks , still waiting ...
B00A7D2L84-0014-0011	2 0 11	0	Will keep

B000BXKIE4-0035-0004	2 1 4	0	it is quieter than my old hoover .
B000BXKIE4-0035-0005	2 1 5	-	Cons :
B000BXKIE4-0035-0006	2 1 6	0	the cord is too short
B000BXKIE4-0035-0007	2 1 7	-	and did n't retract well .
B000BXKIE4-0035-0008	2 1 8	-	Bags fill up quickly
B000BXKIE4-0035-0009	2 1 9	-	as they are small and expensive .
B000BXKIE4-0035-0010	2 1 10	-	It is hard to control
B000BXKIE4-0035-0011	2 1 11	0	when pulling .
B000BXKIE4-0035-0012	2 1 12	-	The floor attachment is to big .
B000BXKIE4-0035-0013	2 1 13	0	The attachments are easily knocked off the wand .
B000BXKIE4-0035-0014	2 1 14	-	I would n't recommend this vacuum .
B00008V40C-0081-0000	2 2 0	+	It works .
B00008V40C-0081-0001	2 2 1	+	Strong power for a small device .
B00008V40C-0081-0002	2 2 2	+	I bought it for my laminate floors
B00008V40C-0081-0003	2 2 3	0	because I researched
B00008V40C-0081-0004	2 2 4	-	that you should not use a vacuum with a beater bar on these floors .
B00008V40C-0081-0005	2 2 5	0	I just installed the floors
B00008V40C-0081-0006	2 2 6	0	and wanted to protect them .
B00008V40C-0081-0007	2 2 7	0	As far as loud , yeah it 's pretty loud , but nothing unbearable .
B00008V40C-0081-0008	2 2 8	0	I think
B00008V40C-0081-0009	2 2 9	0	some people can be just too sensitive .
B00008V40C-0081-0010	2 2 10	0	Probably not louder than a regular vacuum .
B00008V40C-0081-0011	2 2 11	+	But I bought it for the power .

B00008V40C-0081-0014	2 2 14	+	Great for the price .
B00008V40C-0053-0000	2 3 0	+	The Power Stick has great suction
B00008V40C-0053-0001	2 3 1	0	but the opening is only about 3 inches wide
B00008V40C-0053-0002	2 3 2	0	so it takes longer to clean a room then
B00008V40C-0053-0003	2 3 3	0	it would with some other products .
B00008V40C-0053-0004	2 3 4	+	It does a good job though with cat hair and bits of kitty litter .
B00008V40C-0053-0005	2 3 5	0	The noise

B00008V40C-0053-0011	2 3 11	0	the handle was a little longer .
B00008V40C-0053-0012	2 3 12	0	I find myself stooping a bit
B00008V40C-0053-0013	2 3 13	-	when I use
B00008V40C-0053-0014	2 3 14	-	it and I 'm only 5 ' 4 '' .

B0009RF824-0018-0005	3 3 5	-	In the end the motor burned out .
B0009RF824-0018-0006	3 3 6	+	This vac is great for tile and hardwood floors

B0009RF824-0013-0003	3 4 3	-	The handle was always a weak point and it eventually broke -

B0009RF824-0013-0009	3 4 9	-	where the bottom connects to the body also broke ,
B0009RF824-0013-0010	3 4 10	-	rendering it useless .
B0009RF824-0013-0011	3 4 11	-	I am going to have to add it to a landfill
B0009RF824-0013-0012	3 4 12	0	and buy a new one .
B0009RF824-0013-0013	3 4 13	0	I am disappointed
B0009RF824-0013-0014	3 4 14	0	since it was nice and light - good for carrying up to our loft and small enough
B0009RF824-0013-0015	3 4 15	0	to fit in the closet and powerful enough
B0009RF824-0013-0016	3 4 16	0	to clean up cat hair .

B00008V40C-0067-0007	4 0 7	0	and has a nice long cord .
B00008V40C-0067-0008	4 0 8	-	The only downside is
B00008V40C-0067-0009	4 0 9	0	that unlike the big vacuum , there 's no skinny attachment to get into the corners . . but it 's a small downside ,
B00008V40C-0067-0010	4 0 10	0	I just gab the dust buster or broom to compensate .
B00008V40C-0067-0011	4 0 11	+	I am able to vacuum more often
B00008V40C-0067-0012	4 0 12	0	-LRB- my `` big '' vacuum

B00A7D2L84-0007-0008	4 1 8	+	Samsung is a good company ,
B00A7D2L84-0007-0009	4 1 9	-	but clearly they used cheap plastic on this area
B00A7D2L84-0007-0010	4 1 10	-	because a search on Google revealed some others

B005ZFUKG4-0001-0015	4 2 15	0	so it could do
B005ZFUKG4-0001-0016	4 2 16	0	what I boulght it for .
B005ZFUKG4-0001-0017	4 2 17	0	I guess

B005ZFUKG4-0014-0006	4 3 6	0	I could find in stores and on line .
B005ZFUKG4-0014-0007	4 3 7	0	Because I live in a rural area ,
B005ZFUKG4-0014-0008	4 3 8	0	I could not find the Hoover
B005ZFUKG4-0014-0009	4 3 9	0	I selected .
B005ZFUKG4-0014-0010	4 3 10	0	I wanted to lift and check the convenience
B005ZFUKG4-0014-0011	4 3 11	0	of handling it before purchase
B005ZFUKG4-0014-0012	4 3 12	0	but could not at that
B005ZFUKG4-0014-0013	4 3 13	0	time so I ordered it from Amazon .
B005ZFUKG4-0014-0014	4 3 14	+	I was delighted with the handling of this vacuum ,

B005ZFUKG4-0010-0001	4 4 1	0	and was looking for a vacuum
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0002	4 4 2	+	that would do everything
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0003	4 4 3	0	but unfortunately I just could n't find it .
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0004	4 4 4	0	So in order to go from hard floors to carpet I had to invest in two different vacs .
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0005	4 4 5	+	I love my Shark for Carpet
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0006	4 4 6	0	and originally purchased a backpack vacuum
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0007	4 4 7	0	which only lasted me two years
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0008	4 4 8	-	before the motor went out .
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0009	4 4 9	0	I did not want another backpack

B005ZFUKG4-0010-0011	4 4 11	+	but liked the concept
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0012	4 4 12	0	because I do n't like canister vacs .
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0013	4 4 13	+	Based on reviews I went with this one for $ 75 .
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0014	4 4 14	+	The suction is amazing
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0015	4 4 15	+	and does
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0016	4 4 16	+	exactly what I wanted it too .
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0017	4 4 17	0	I only have two drawbacks on this vac , one

B005ZFUKG4-0010-0019	4 4 19	-	and the wand is a bit short for me
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0020	4 4 20	0	but there 's only a few jobs
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0021	4 4 21	0	I have
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0022	4 4 22	+	that I need this little beauty
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0023	4 4 23	+	for so it 's perfect .
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0024	4 4 24	-	Brush head is small ,
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0025	4 4 25	-	my old one does n't fit on this
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0026	4 4 26	0	and was twice as wide .
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0027	4 4 27	0	Going to see
B005ZFUKG4-0010-0028	4 4 28	+	if they sell additional attachments to suit my needs .
